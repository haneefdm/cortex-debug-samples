# cortex-debug-samples

Repo for storing misc. stuff related to corted-debug testing

File cortex-debug-0.X.Y.vsix is my latest cortex-debug extension that contains certain fixes. Will keep this available until my changes are officially merged into <https://github.com/Marus/cortex-debug>

**WARNING:** _This package may contain stuff that is not fully tested and may not ever make it to an official release. Once you install this, you may not get automatic updates. Please check with the main repo for updates and uninstall this copy when done._

## Install from vsix

* Download the vsix file
* Select the Extension Viewlet on left edge of VSCode where you see all the extensions
* On top right, click on the '...' and select "Install from VSIX" and select the file just downloaded
* Or, from the command line, you can do
